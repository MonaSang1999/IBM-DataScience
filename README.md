# IBM - MachineLearning
IBM Machine Learning Course from Coursera


## Intro
 - AI Component
 - Machine Learning: Classification, Regression, Clustering, Neural Network etc
 - Revolution in ML: Deep Learning

Data Preprocessing -> Feature Selection -> Train/Test Split -> Algorithm setup -> Model fitting -> Tuning parameters -> Prediction -> Evaluation -> Model Export

:thought_balloon: **Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning**
 - Supervised: teach the model (with data from a **labeled** dataset) then with that knowledge, it can predict unknown or future instances:
   - Classification is the process of predicting a discrete class label, or category.
   - Regression is the process of predicting a continuous value
 - Unsupervised: let the model work on its own to discover information that may not be visible (trains on the dataset, and draws conclusions on **unlabeled** data):
   - Dimension reduction / Feature Selection: reducing redundant features to make the classification easier.
   - Market basket analysis is a modeling technique based upon the theory that if you buy a certain group of items.
   - Density estimation is a very simple concept that is mostly used to explore the data to find some structure within it.
   - Clustering is used for grouping data points, or objects that are somehow similar. (for discovering structure, summarization, and anomaly detection)
